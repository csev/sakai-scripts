# Compile all of the Sakai source in the right order

# A good way to do this is:
#
# rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/sakaiproject
# bash qmv.sh | tee /tmp/qmv.out
#
# This way you get a log of what happens and figure out any loose 
# linkage or sloppy dependencies.
#
# Here is a good command to run on the log:
#
# egrep 'Downloading.*\/sakaiproject|====' /tmp/qmv.out | grep -v plugins | sed 's/.*Downloading/Downloading/'
# 
# This will show you which bits of the final compile were downloaded instead of compiled
# You should see none # if we are generating all the binary artifacts from source and things are
# pointing to the right versions.
